# T3 Code Flatpak

[T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code) repackaged as a Flatpak from the upstream AppImage.

It is still technically the upstream AppImage payload, installed into a Flatpak wrapper for immutable and atomic systems. This repository is based on the packaging pattern used by the [Vesktop Flathub repo](https://github.com/flathub/dev.vencord.Vesktop).

## Wayland

T3 Code runs natively on Wayland when launched from a Wayland session. X11 is still
available as a fallback on non-Wayland sessions through Flatpak's `fallback-x11`
socket.

## Sandbox

The default sandbox grants display, IPC, network, portal-based file picking, and
cursor theme access. It does not grant access to the full home directory, SSH
agent, host command spawning, or broad host filesystems.

Provider CLIs, source-control tools, and project directory access are expected
to be unavailable until later packaging phases add explicit support.
